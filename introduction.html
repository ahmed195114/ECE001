	<text>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will one day become the most powerful technology in human history,
	being either the best thing ever to happen to humanity, or the worst.
	Polls have shown that most AI researchers expect artificial general intelligence (AGI) within decades,
	able to perform all cognitive tasks at super-human level.
	This could enable dramatic acceleration of science and technology, curing  diseases, eliminating poverty and helping life spread into our cosmos.
	But it could also enable unprecedented inequality, surveillance, power concentration and accidents.
	How can we reap the benefits of AI without being replaced on the job market and perhaps altogether?
